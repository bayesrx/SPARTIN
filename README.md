# SPARTIN

An implementation of the components of the SPARTIN pipeline in R. 

`SPARTIN` can be installed via `devtools` using the command `devtools::install_github('bayesrx/SPARTIN')` in R. 

There is also a general vignette available. In order to use it, the package must instead be installed with `devtools::install_github('bayesrx/SPARTIN', build_vignettes = TRUE)`. Note that this will take some time, as the vignette is quite extensive. Once the package has been installed and the vignettes built, use the command `vignette("SPARTIN-General-Usage")` after loading the `SPARTIN` package in order to view it.
